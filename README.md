## What is ScanBus-BR?

ScanBus-BR is a free Modbus Master / Client simulator software (Freeware) that stands out for its versatility and simplicity.

The ScanBus is PORTABLE, meaning it DOES NOT REQUIRE INSTALLATION and can be used even on pen drives.

Free from any advertising or any Adware.

Designed to help developers find errors in slave devices and for anyone who wants to simulate, test and study the Modbus protocol.

You will hardly find another free or even paid software that will provide you with as many features as ScanBus-BR

Errors and exception codes are displayed in the status line and in data traffic.

### Available protocols:

- RTU(serial)
- TCP/IP
- RTU over TCP/IP

### Operating systems:

- Windows 7, 10 and 11 (64 bits).
- Linux "Various" (64-bit).

#### Options:
- Display only valid data.
- Show exception (exception indicates that the device ID exists but something is wrongly configured).
- Stop when found (when a valid register is found, the scan ends).
- Stop at the end (when it reaches the value of Id = 255, finish the scan, otherwise it will return to ID 1 cyclically).
- Save to .CSV file (with separator choice).
